# CapstoneF21_MovieReviewClassification
Developing a classification model for sentiment analysis of 50,000 movie reviews from IMDB

# Dataset
Contains 50,000 movie reviews from IMDB split into 25,000 positive reviews and 25,000 negative reviews
**IMDB Dataset.csv** contains the dataset

# Pre-processing
**Pre-processing.py** and **Pre-processing.py** are the files that contain the different processing steps that needed to be performed before the modelling stage

# Modeling
**Sentiment_Analysis_Movie_Reviews.ipynb** contains the overall project code including the pre-processing as well as the data descriptions and the baseline Naive Bayes model used for the classification problem

# Final Code
**Next Step** Will include the addition of the other models and feature selection methods that are required to improve the model metrics
